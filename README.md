- WHEN the user chooses to view all of the departments, then they are presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids.
- WHEN the user chooses to view all of the roles, then they are presented with the job title, role id, the department that specific role belongs to, and the salary for that role
- WHEN the user chooses to view all of the employees, then they are presented with a formatted table showing employee data including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
- WHEN the user chooses to add a department, then they are prompted to enter the name of the department and that specific department added goes into the database
- WHEN the user chooses to add a role, then they are prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
- WHEN the user chooses to add an employee, then they are prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database
